		'make clean':
			Will delete the token ring compiled byte code files.
		
		'make prepare':
			Will create input-file-{1..5} so that the application could generate frames.

		'make build':
			Will delete and re-compile the token ring project.

		'make run':
			Will run 'make build' and then execute the token ring project.
